Here you will find a very short description of the work done:
- preprocessing the data (looking up what we could extract from it)
- creating one scatter plot of cases each day and another one for accumulative stats
- Create a donut plot to show infection reason
- Create a map visualisation along with a bar chart to visualise cases per province
- Create a slider to update the map and the bar chart content depending on the date 


Things I may think about for later
- adding style and organize my app
- maybe I shouldn't have all the code in one sheet... I should think about distributing it
- more interactivity maybe ...
